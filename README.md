# Walmart Sales Analysis and Prediction
A data science project analyzing Walmart sales data to understand trends and predict future revenue. The project combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with machine learning to provide insights and forecasting.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Exploration
- Sales distribution analysis
- Temporal trends (yearly, monthly, seasonal)
- Store performance comparison
- Holiday impact analysis
- Correlation studies

### Part 2: Revenue Prediction
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Random Forest modeling

## Key Features
- Interactive visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib
- Outlier detection using z-scores
- Seasonality analysis
- Holiday sales impact
- Machine learning prediction model

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas & numpy
- matplotlib & seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Random Forest Regressor

## Results
- Identified seasonal sales patterns
- Analyzed holiday impact on revenue
- Built prediction model with R² score on test data
- Generated store-specific insights

## Data Requirements
Dataset should include:
- Store information
- Weekly sales data
- Holiday flags
- Temperature data
- Fuel prices
- CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- Unemployment rates

## Usage
1. Load and prepare data
2. Run EDA section for insights
3. Execute prediction model
4. Evaluate results using RMSE and R²
